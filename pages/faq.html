        <button class="acc">How To Purchase A Car From Us</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>That’s easy: select a car from our current inventory and submit payment, or select a vehicle from our list of inbound vehicle and place your deposit. When the vehicle arrives, pay the balance with cash or certified funds and drive your dream car off the lot.<br>
          If you don’t see the car you want in our inventory or on our inbound vehicle list, talk to us about your needs and we’ll acquire the vehicle for you. A deposit will be needed to execute this process.<br>
          When the vehicle arrives, you must have the funds in hand before we will release the vehicle.  Please look at the payment options and financing options tabs below for guidance. We do not accept payments from private individuals as we are not a lending institution.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">How Long Does It Take To Get A Car From Us</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Short answer: it depends. If the car is already on a container to us, it’ll be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.<br>
          If the car you want is not already in-transit, we need to find a suitable vehicle from one of our trusted resources in Japan. Then, it must be inspected to ensure the car is up to our quality standards.<br>
          We stay in close contact with our buyers until such time as they have agreed upon on their selection.  Then we simply await the arrival of the chosen car.  Upon arrival in the U.S., we do the mechanical inspection, service any items that need service, and complete the paperwork. That process takes about a week.<br>
          The best advice we can give is to constantly monitor our website for inbound vehicles. If you see something you like, get your money together immediately and make a deposit to hold the car. Since all monies are due upon delivery, you’ll want to make 100% sure your finances are in order or the vehicle goes to the next person in line.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">What Terms Of Financing Do We Accept</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We don’t offer financing as we are not a lender. There are however, a myriad of resources to assist with payments.<br>
          Private lenders like Avant make personal loans and are great to deal with. If you’re not already a member of a credit union, join one. Lending from credit unions tends to be easier. Conventional banks are probably the last resort, as lending restrictions are tighter here.<br>
          In most cases, you’ll be looking for a personal loan, as a loan on an imported car is often not consider a “secured loan.” As such, interest rates are higher on these loans and are more difficult to get. Some lenders might require an independent third party appraisal ( we can help recommend one) in order to get financed. Of course, the best option is to pay cash. Sufficient cash can be procured a number of ways, including loans against hard assets, property or other vehicles.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">Do You Offer Financing</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No, not directly. Work through private lenders like Avant, USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union, Woodside Credit, or credit unions for the best deals. We are not a lender and we do not accept payments from private individuals.<br>
          Generally speaking, you will be applying for a personal loan and your credit score will need to be 620 or better or you will have to have a co-signer. Be 100% sure your finances are in order before placing a deposit on a vehicle.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">Are Our Cars 50 State Legal</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There is a difference between being legal in certain states and being federally legal.
          Almost any car can be registered in a variety of states, with each state having its own set of rules. States like Montana, Florida, Oregon and others are quite lax and require little more than a VIN # and certificate of title.<br>
          States like California are different and require more paperwork. Talk to us during the buying process so that we can help guide you through the process and help you select a vehicle that will be easy to register and enjoy in your home state.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">How do I get my car registered in my state?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Titling and registering your new JDM car in your home state is usually fairly cut and dry due to the fact that the car will come with a valid Florida title. Please feel free to call us and talk to any of our experienced staff to find out the specifics on your state.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">What is the quality of the vehicles we offer?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Every car we bring in goes through a rigorous inspection before we import it. We do not accept cars that have been in any accidents. While these cars have been driven regularly, the condition must considered “excellent” for their age and mileage before we’ll even consider them.<br>
          Upon arrival in the U.S. we inspect all vehicles again and perform any maintenance that we feel is necessary. No car leaves our facility without a full inspection, inside and out, underneath the car, and in the trunk. All systems are tested to ensure there are no electrical issues. The HVAC system is tested for proper operation and the vehicle is test driven.<br>
          Issues that arise during any part of this process are addressed and resolved before the vehicle is offered for sale. Final inspection is done by the buyer. This process has worked for us for 14 years and we’re proud to say that while we may not be the best price on certain cars, we’re certainly the best value. We don’t buy “roach” cars and we certainly don’t sell cars that we wouldn’t own and drive ourselves.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">What paperwork comes with the car?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Our vehicles include a valid Florida title in the buyer’s name with the proper JDM VIN.
          Depending upon the year, make and model you’ve purchased, the documentation provided is more than sufficient to get the vehicle registered in most states. Some cars we offer cannot be registered into some states due to their individual laws. This is why it’s important to know where you live before you purchase a car.<br>
          Because of the laws that vary from state to state, it is imperative that you discuss your plans with us prior to a purchase</p>
        </div>
        <button class="acc">Can you help me legalize a car I bought elsewhere?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>In short, no. Since we cannot control the critical process of how the car was brought into the country, there’s a high probability that it cannot be titled unless the car is returned to its home country then brought it again, legally. However, if your JDM car is already in the US and you have the proper paperwork, we can title it for you.<br>
          Remember that there is a HUGE difference between getting a car registered in any given state vs. it being FEDERALLY legal. There are no ways around these laws and anyone who tells you it can be done is lying. Don’t fall victim to these dishonest and illegal practices. We can cite case after case where care have been seized and crushed.</p>
